## Introduction

Crochet may look like pure art, but hidden beneath every stitch is a precise mathematical structure.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the crochet sphere—the foundation for amigurumi heads, toy balls, and ornaments.

If your “ball” keeps turning into a lumpy potato, the fix is math: distribute **increases and decreases** so the fabric curves smoothly.

## 1) Geometry in Plain Terms

A sphere’s circumference at any “latitude” dictates how many stitches a round needs.

- Too few stitches → fabric cups inward.
- Too many stitches → fabric ruffles.
- Just right → a smooth curve.

We build spheres in phases:

1. **Increase phase** → from the magic ring up to the equator.  
2. **(Optional) straight belt** → keep circumference constant for a thicker middle.  
3. **Decrease phase** → mirror the increases to close neatly.

## 2) The Classic 6-Increase Rule (Single Crochet)

For flat circles in **single crochet (sc)**, you add **6 stitches per round**:

- R1: MR, **6** sc → 6  
- R2: inc in each → 12  
- R3: (sc 1, inc) × 6 → 18  
- R4: (sc 2, inc) × 6 → 24  
- R5: (sc 3, inc) × 6 → 30  
- …

For a **sphere**, increase by +6 per round until you reach your target width, then mirror with **−6 per round** on the way down.

> Why 6? With sc, the stitch geometry approximates a hex-based tiling on the plane; +6/round keeps arc length aligned with growing circumference.

## 3) Sizing: From Diameter to Rounds

Let:
- `d` = target diameter (cm)
- `st_per_cm` = your gauge (stitches per cm) measured around a round
- `r = d / 2`

A simple, practical plan:
- **Max round stitch count** ≈ `circumference × st_per_cm`  
- Circumference ≈ `π × d`

Then the **number of increase rounds** is roughly:
rounds_up ≈ (max_stitches / 6)
Mirror for decreases.

## 4) Real-World Adjustments

- **Yarn & hook:** Thicker yarn or larger hook → fewer rounds to reach the same size.
- **Tension:** Tighter tension → more stitches per cm → more rounds.
- **Stitch type:** hdc/dc have taller stitches and change the curve; the +6 rule is sc-specific.

## 5) Quick Generator (JavaScript)

Use this small helper to sketch a stitch-count plan:

```js
function spherePlan(diameterCm, stitchesPerCm) {
  const maxStitches = Math.round(Math.PI * diameterCm * stitchesPerCm);
  const roundsUp = Math.max(1, Math.round(maxStitches / 6));
  const up = Array.from({ length: roundsUp }, (_, i) => 6 * (i + 1));
  const down = up.slice(0, -1).reverse();
  return [...up, ...down];
}

// Example: 10 cm ball, 4 stitches per cm
console.log(spherePlan(10, 4));
// -> e.g., [6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60,54,48,42,36,30,24,18,12,6]

```
Use the output as your per-round stitch counts. If you want a belt (constant circumference), repeat the max count for a few rounds before decreasing.

## 6) Example Pattern (Small Sphere, sc)

Gauge (example): ~4 sts/cm in the round

Target: ~6–7 cm diameter (adjust as needed)
R1: MR, 6 sc                                   [6]
R2: inc in each                                [12]
R3: (sc 1, inc) × 6                            [18]
R4: (sc 2, inc) × 6                            [24]
R5: (sc 3, inc) × 6                            [30]
R6: (sc 4, inc) × 6                            [36]
R7: (sc 5, inc) × 6                            [42]
R8: (sc 6, inc) × 6                            [48]

(Optional belt) R9–R10: sc around              [48]

R11: (sc 6, dec) × 6                           [42]
R12: (sc 5, dec) × 6                           [36]
R13: (sc 4, dec) × 6                           [30]
R14: (sc 3, dec) × 6                           [24]
R15: (sc 2, dec) × 6                           [18]
R16: (sc 1, dec) × 6                           [12]
R17: dec in each                               [6]
Fasten off, weave ends.

If you see ruffling before the equator, skip one increase round. If it cups inward, add one.

Wrap-Up
Perfect crochet spheres aren’t luck—they’re controlled increases that match a growing circumference, then a mirror decrease to close. Once you know your gauge, you can generate stitch counts for any size ball, every time.

Next up: extending this math to ellipsoids and stylized amigurumi heads (different growth rates on different axes).
